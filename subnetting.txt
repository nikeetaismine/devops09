SUBNETTING
------------
Create 4 subnets from the following IP address: 198.67.23.0

No. of subnets = 2^n	 where n = no. of bits that belong to the host portion
If we only need 4 subnets, then 4 = 2^n. Therefore, n = 2.

Total no. of usable hosts = 2^n - 2 = 2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.


Steps taken when subnetting
---------------------------

1. Break down the IP to understand it.

	Class	SubnetMask	CIDRRange
	-----	----------	---------
	C	255.255.255.0	198.67.23.0/24

2. convert the IP address from decimal to binary

	198.67.23.0 => 11000110.01000011.00010111.00000000
	255.255.255.0 => 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

	128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
	___	__	__	__	_	_	_	_

3. Calculate the no. of host bits (n) that can be given to the network portion as required by the subnets

	n = 2, as seen above.
	So we add these two bits to the CIDR Range = 198.67.23.0/26
	This implies that: New Subnet mask in  binary = 1100110.01000011.00010111.11000000
	And the new subnet mask in decimal = 255.255.255.192

4. Identify the four subnet ranges

	New Subnet mask in  binary = 1100110.01000011.00010111.11000000
	No. of its usable hosts = 2^n - 2 where n = 6 
	Total no of hosts = 2^n = 2^6 = 64

	Our IP address is 198.67.23.0

	First subnet range = 198.67.23.0 - 198.67.23.63
	First subnet range = 198.67.23.64 - 198.67.23.127
	First subnet range = 198.67.23.128 - 198.67.23.191
	First subnet range = 198.67.23.192 - 198.67.23.255

Question 2
----------
Create 5 subnets from this IP address 198.67.23.0

1. Break down the IP to understand it.

        Class   SubnetMask      CIDRRange
        -----   ----------      ---------
        C       255.255.255.0   198.67.23.0/24

2. convert the IP address from decimal to binary

        198.67.23.0 => 11000110.01000011.00010111.00000000
        255.255.255.0 => 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

        128     64      32      16      8       4       2       1
        ___     __      __      __      _       _       _       _

3. Calculate the no. of host bits (n) that can be given to the network portion as required by the subnets

	No. of subnets = 5 = 2^n
	Since 5 is not a power of 2, we take the next minimum number, 8, which is 2^3.
		Therefore, n = 3
	and the number of host bits required to be added to the network = 3
	New subnet mask in binary = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
	New subnet mask in decimal = 255.255.255.224

	Number of total hosts = 2^5 = 32
	We will have a total of 32 hosts per subnet - including the network and

	First subnet range = 198.67.23.0 - 198.67.23.31
	First subnet range = 198.67.23.32 - 198.67.23.63
	First subnet range = 198.67.23.64 - 198.67.23.95
	First subnet range = 198.67.23.96 - 198.67.23.127
	First subnet range = 198.67.23.128 - 198.67.23.159



		  MORE EXAMPLES
		-----------------

Create four subnets from 172.25.17.0

Subnet Mask	CIDR Range		
255.255.0.0	172.25.17.0/16

Subnet Mask in Binary = 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000

IP Address in Binary:

128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1

172.25.0.0 => 10101100.00011001.00000000.00000000

4 = 2^n ==> n = 2

So we use two more bits to subnet 
11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000= 255.255.192.0 
Total No of host bits (including network and broadcast address)
 = 2^n = 2^14 = 16384
Usable host bits = 2^n - 2

Subnet ranges:
			Network 	Broadcast			First usable	Last usable 
			Address		 Address			Address			Address
Range 1:	172.25.0.0 - 172.25.63.255		172.25.0.1		172.25.63.254
Range 2:	172.25.64.0 - 172.25.127.255	172.25.64.1		172.25.127.254
Range 3:	172.25.128.0 - 172.25.191.255	172.25.128.1 	172.25.191.254
Range 4:	172.25.192.0 - 172.25.255.255	172.25.192.1	172.25.255.254
